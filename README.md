# Pixeleers

## Description

We, as developers, collaborated on how to explore and join the art-creation community. Our initial concept was too large a scope with the deadline presented. Thus, we compromised on a smaller scope art-creation design. Here, our Pixeleers App utilized a grid-style layout, akin to a pixel-art blueprint. Pixel-art NFTS were initially the inspiration of our entire project.

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
