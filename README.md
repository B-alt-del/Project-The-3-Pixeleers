## Description

We, as developers, collaborated on how to explore and join the art-creation community. Our initial concept was too large a scope with the deadline presented. Thus, we compromised on a smaller scope art-creation design. Here, our Pixeleers App utilized a grid-style layout, akin to a pixel-art blueprint. Pixel-art NFTS were initially the inspiration of our entire project.
